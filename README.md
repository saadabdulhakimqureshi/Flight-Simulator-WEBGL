# Project I: Flight Simulator
# CS 440 Computer Graphics, Fall 2022
***

# Purpose

This project assesses your mastery of viewing transformations. It brings together many of the topics we cover in Module II. These are:

- viewing
- shading
- interaction
- geometry

# Background

For this assignment, you should
- be able to visualize 3D Cartesian space
- understand camera parameters and their representation in WebGL
- be able to capture user interaction and have it effect your WebGL program
- know the various shading schemes
- be able to judge the best platform (CPU/application program vs. GPU/shader) to execute a desired functionality
- be able to apply trigonometric operations
- understand the memory interaction between the CPU and the GPU
- know WebGL's coordinate system and drawing routines
- be able to write one or more files in order to display GPU-supported renderings in an HMTL page
- be able to look up, where necessary, and implement the functions and syntax in HTML, JavaScript, and WebGL for desired functionality.

# The Problem Set

The problems are defined in `proj1.tex` which is to be compiled using a LaTeX compiler.

# Previous Feedback

Feedback from the previous set of students who attempted this assignment is summarized in the accompanying file, `feedback.md`. 

The project was attempted in teams of 4 and was released when some topics had not yet been covered. Taking the feedback into account, we have done more WebGL assignments beforehand, and the recitations have covered WebGL extensively and provided a demo of the project. All the topics have been completely covered before the release of the project.

# Submission

There are 2 parts to the submission. There is no peer review as the submission will be graded by WS.

## 1. Problem Set

Please follow the naming instructions exactly. The correctly named files in your GitHub repository at the time of the deadline will be considered your submission. Your submission will be graded _as is_, so make sure to include all the necessary files.

This is a __team submission__, i.e. a single submission per team. Your team has a single repository to which each of you will have access. Your team submission will be assigned a __Submission Score__ based on the correctness of the contained solutions.

_Deadline_: 2359h on Monday, 21 November.

## 2. Feedback Form


You will provide feedback on your team and on the project by filling the feedback form which will be made available on the course page on LMS. This is due at the same time as the problem solutions.

This is an __individual submission__, i.e. each of you has to fill the form. Doing so contributes to your __Team Factor__ which is 1 by default and is penalized in case of non-submission of the form, dishonest feedback, or unequal contribution to the submission as reported by your buddies and/or the commit history on GitHub.

_Deadline_: 2359h on Monday, 21 November.

# Grading

Your submission will be graded as per the criteria specified in the accompanying file, _rubric.xlsx_. This will contribute to your _Submission Score_.

Your individual score in this homework is the product of your Submission Score and Team Factor.

# Discussion

There is a lot to handle and there are bound to be confusions and queries. Please share them using the following avenues.

- discuss with your buddies,
- the corresponding discussion thread on LMS,
- discuss with your peers,
- consult with course staff.

# Tips

- This project involves a lot of work so start early.
- There is no late submission. Submit whatever you have by the deadline.
- Failure to turn in any of the above submissions will result in a deduction of marks for the homework.
- viel Spa√ü!
